                     <p1>Hello to all of you beautiful people here, I am going to share a little about myself. So let me start by saying that I am a very chill kind of person,I love to stay calm and relaxed all the times even if I have a lot of things bugging me. The things I detest are violence, jealousy, hatred, discrimination on the basis of race,sex,language,eating habits,appearance.</p1>
                     <p2>I am a peace loving guy and I would want the world to live,eat,play,dance together and co-exist peacefully.</p2>
                     <p3>Humanity in it's core is about showing care, spreading love, embracing differences, eliminating evil.</p3>
                     <p4>I myself, am a very caring, compassionate person and I always have a positive attitude towards other humans. We are all in this together as ONE.Everyone should prosper,everyone should grow together and it is also our moral duty to take care of and respect the lives of animals that inhabit the Earth.</p4>
